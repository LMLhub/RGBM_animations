 Generate animations of wealth following re-allocating geometric Brownian motion

RGBM.py generates wealth trajectories that follow re-allocating geometric Brownian motion. 

For details on the RGBM model, see this blog post

tau_animations.py
reads the data generated by RGBM.py and produces lots of pdf files in the folder 
./animation_pics/-05/

To turn these pdf's into a .gif or .mov one currently has to use a conversion tool (Preview can convert to .gif on a mac, or search online).
