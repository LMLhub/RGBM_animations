# RGBM_animations
 Generate animations of wealth following re-allocating geometric Brownian motion

./code/RGBM.py generates wealth trajectories that follow re-allocating geometric Brownian motion. 
They're saved in ./data in .pkl format

For details on the RGBM model, see this blog post

./code/tau_animations.py
reads the data generated by RGBM.py and produces lots of pdf files in the folder 
./figures/animation_pics/-05/

To turn these pdf's into a .gif or .mov one currently has to use a conversion tool (Preview can convert to .gif on a mac, or search online).

./code/all_vs_time.py generates plots of all trajectories vs. time, saved in ./figures/trajectories/
